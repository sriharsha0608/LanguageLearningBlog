<h3><b>Elaborated Details</b></h3>
<p>
This week I have learned about different ways to declare variables and how to concatenate two strings in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  There are 3 different ways to create and declare <a href="https://github.com/sriharsha0608/LanguageLearningBlog/blob/main/code/variables.js">variables</a>. 
  <ol type="1">
    <li><code>Using var keyword</code></li>
    <p> var is used to create and declare variables.</p>
    <li><code>Using let keyword</code></li>
    
<p>  When using let, you can reassign the values. If you declare a variable and leave it unassigned, it will automatically initialize with a value of undefined.</p>
    <li><code>Using const keyword</code></li>
    
 <p> When you use const you cannot reassign the values. You cannot leave a variable unassigned when using const, as it will leave SyntaxError. </p>
   </ol>
  </p>
<p>I have also learned how to <a href="https://github.com/sriharsha0608/LanguageLearningBlog/blob/main/code/concatenation.js"> Concatenate</a>.</p>
<code>
  let favoriteAnimal='Dog';<br>
  console.log('My favorite animal:'+ favoriteAnimal);
</code>
<br>
<p>
The main challenge I faced when learning JavaScript is finding a good source to learn. There are lots of sources to learn JavaAcript like Codecademy, Udemy, Javatpoint,
youtube or using chatGPT etc., I've decided to learn using Codecademy and youtube. Codecademy is free and has good content in it. The other challenge is using new 
keywords and new datatypes. It may take some time but as I move forward it'll be easy.
