I have decided to learn JavaScript.
When I started doing research about what programming languages are in demand right now, I found JavaScript is the most used language. 
The demand for it is not going to go away anytime soon. It can be used on multiple platforms such as mobile applications, web applications, and desktop applications. 
Also, I havenâ€™t learned JavaScript before. So, I decided to go with JavaScript.
